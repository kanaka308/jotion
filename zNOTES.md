# Every folder inside of app that has a page file becomes a route

# It is important not to add components folder inside of app folder so..

# if you don't want it to be route then add "_" before the name of the file like *_components*

# We can also create "(root)" folder and it doesn't have any effect on routing, it is added just to have a good folder structure

# We can also create many layouts by creating a layout.tsx file iside a oraginzational('(folder_name)') folder
